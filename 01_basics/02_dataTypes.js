    // bigInt => usually for stock market related projects
    //string,

    //undefined     => like let name;   // varriable declare but not assign any value yet,
    
    // null     => its a standalone value  like let temprature=null, // means value not fetch

    // 2. Non-primtive data types

    //  object

    console.log(typeof undefined)  // its undefined

    console.log(typeof null)        // its give us object, some times says it the drawback of the language
